A Python Pygame application that visualizes uninformed search algorithms (BFS, DFS, UCS, DLS, IDDFS, Bidirectional) in an interactive grid. Users set Start, Target, and walls, while real-time animation shows Frontier, Explored nodes, and the final path, demonstrating algorithm behavior and efficiency.
